## What to find on this site?

First of all welcome here! I d hope that yu'll find some interesting informations while navigating through these pages. By going to the [Research]({{"/research/" | absolute_url}}) tab, you will find out more about what questions I am exploring. Clicking on the [Publication]({{"/publications/" | absolute_url}}) tab, you will end up with a more-or-less updated list of publications. For the non-reseacher out there, publications are the crux of scientific work. When two researchers speak together, 50% of the time they talk about their paper. Finally, here you may also find my [Blog]({{"/blog/" | absolute_url}}) where I talk about:

* R: best stat software in the world,
* Statistics: equivalent to data juggling, 
* Ecology: how all organisms on this planet are connected and,
* Academia: this weird working place where weird people try to do science.

## Where is biologyforfun.wordpress?
