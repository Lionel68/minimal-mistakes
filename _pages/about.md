## Who am I?

I am currently employed as a PostDoc by the university of Ghent working at [TEREC](http://www.ecology.ugent.be/terec/) and [ForNaLab](https://www.ugent.be/bw/dfwm/en/research/fornalab) within the [TREEWEB](http://www.treedivbelgium.ugent.be/pl_treeweb.html) project.

Before that I did my PhD at the Technical University of Munich with the [terestrial ecology group](http://www.toek.wzw.tum.de/index.php?id=2) and working on how plant diversity affect arthropod communities and the ecosystem functions that they perform. This was done within the framework of the [Jena experiment](http://www.the-jena-experiment.de/), you can read my PhD thesis from the [mediaTUM](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1342896/1342896.pdf) website.
