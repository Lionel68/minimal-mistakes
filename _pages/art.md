## Cardioid

{% include gallery caption="Cardioid is based on two moving circles, they form very nice patterns, have a look at the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioid) page to find more infos or click [here](https://github.com/lionel68/lionel68.github.io/blob/master/_art_script/cardioid.R) for the R script used." %}
