So .. just a quick post to share with you my first lecture ever. It was for a master course that my working group is running on Experimental design and statistics in ecology. I talked about tools for non-normal data in ecology. I felt rather confortable and I hope that my messages got somehow into their head. Anyhow it was extremely pleasant to say: "Here is what is very likely to fall for the exam..."

Here is the link to the lecture: https://www.dropbox.com/s/1s915v10mr09z56/GLM_lecture.pdf

Enjoy it!
