I gave today a lecture to master student in ecology about this field of research I am working on which is biodiversity and ecosystem function. You may find the presentation here: [http://www.slideshare.net/Lionel_68/ringvorlesung-bef-2014](http://www.slideshare.net/Lionel_68/ringvorlesung-bef-2014)



Soon will come post about why and how we do this type of research.
