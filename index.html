Welcome to my professional website I hope that youâ€™ll find it helpful. 
<br><br>
A few words about me:
<br><br>
I am currently employed as a PostDoc by the university of Ghent working partly at <a href='http://www.ecology.ugent.be/terec/' target='_blank'>TEREC</a> and partly at <a href='https://www.ugent.be/bw/dfwm/en/research/fornalab' target='_blank'>ForNaLab</a> within the <a href='http://www.treedivbelgium.ugent.be/pl_treeweb.html' target='_blank'>TREEWEB</a>.
<br><br>
Before that I did my PhD at the Technical University of Munich with the <a href='http://www.toek.wzw.tum.de/index.php?id=2' target='_blank'>Terrestrial ecology group</a> and working on how plant diversity affect arthropod communities and the ecosystem functions that they perform. This was done within the framework of the <a href='http://www.the-jena-experiment.de/' target='_blank'>Jena experiement</a>, you can find the results from these 4 years of work at the <a href='https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1342896/1342896.pdf' target='_blank'>mediaTUM</a> website.
